# Architecture Decision Records

One file per decision: `NNNN-short-title.md`, copied from [0000-template.md](0000-template.md).

## Status values
- **proposed**: written by Claude, waiting for the PM. Nothing may be built on it.
- **accepted**: approved by the PM. Record who and when in the ADR.
- **rejected**: not approved. Keep the file, and record why.
- **superseded by NNNN**: replaced by a later ADR.

## Rules
- Any decision that affects user experience gets an ADR with status `proposed`, and it is listed under
  "Needs user decision" in [../handoff.md](../handoff.md). No work builds on it until it is accepted.
- Claims about Glance or a library cite the version and the date the source was read. Write "not verified"
  where that is true.
- Only the PM changes the status from `proposed`. Exception: a **non-UX** ADR may be implemented in the PR that
  introduces it; merging that PR accepts it (the PM sees it in review). UX-impacting ADRs always wait for explicit approval.
